# Sourcery templates

The purpose of this repository is to provide a place where we can share sourcery templates and come back to whenever we need one, rather than look through projects we had been working on previously.

## Available templates
- [AutoMockable](https://git.appunite.com/damian.kolasinski/sourcery-templates/tree/master/AutoMockable)
